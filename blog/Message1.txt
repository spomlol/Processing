Hi everybody! As you are probably aware by now, I'm Cedric and I'm doing my internship in Barcelona!
<br><br>
Before I talk about Barcelona I'll just give a bit of background about myself!
I'm a student at the university college of Howest, Brugge, Belgium. I've been in this school for just under 4 years now. 
My first three years were for a bachelors degree in Biomedical Laboratory Technology. 
As a specialisation training program in the third year I chose Pharmaceutical and Biological Laboratory Technology.
<a href="https://www.howest.be/en/programmes/bachelor/biomedical-laboratory-technology">You can read more about the program over here!<a>
To finalize my bachelors degree I had to take a traineeship. When I got the opportunity to go abroad I grasped it with both hands. So I went to Sweden for about 4-5 months.
More specifically in Uppsala, I very beautifull city just north of Stockholm. I also needed to keep a blog on that, which you can find over <a href="https://cedrichermans.wixsite.com/sweden">here.</a> 
The project I helped on has been released by now and you can read the abstract over <a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/early/2019/03/28/jcs.228544.long?fbclid=IwAR1wcbnCbjuIMslqzMFLMPh9Zg0-q0zd7kZGsRcClDGxlr8q5ptDcBimDak"> here. </a>
Feel free to ask me anything about it by contacting me through one of the means at the bottom right of this page.
<br><br>
After this course I decided to do the advanced bachelor in Bioinformatics (<a href="https://www.howest.be/en/programmes/advanced-bachelor/bioinformatics">which can also be followed at home!</a>).
I again had the opportunity to go abroad, so this time, I decided to go from somewhere cold to somewhere warm (With some in between steps, but those are not that important). So in the end I choose for Barcelona.
Since the school had visited the <a href="http://www.prbb.org/">PRBB</a> in Barcelona whilst on a study trip, they had made some contacts with some people over here. And it wasn't long before they confirmed I could come here.
<br><br>
This brings us to the present day. On Friday, the 5th of April, at 8:30 am, I had my final exam. A mere 21,5 hours later, my parents and me would be on the train on my way to the airport. Another 6-7 hours later, I had set foot in Barcelona.
I went to my little appartment (It's little but cozy). And I met up with my landlord/landlady. She was really nice and showed us everything that was over there. For the rest of the day we went to walk around a lot. 
The following days we did the same. We visited already a lot of places, but this city is unimaginably big. So there is still a lot to explore.
On Tuesday, April 9th, my parents went home. At 11 'o clock I was expected at the PRBB to be introduced to the other members of the lab and to take care of a bit of paperwork.
The people I've met seem really nice and I'm looking forward to work with them.
As the details of my project are not yet that clear I'll keep the details for a later blog post.
I start on Monday, April 15th. So for now I still have some time to explore. Which I am going to do right now!<br> In the meanwhile, feel free to take a look at the gallery of pictures that I took.
Mind you that I made this website myself and it's not the most efficiënt so loading the pictures is a tad slow, but give it some time. You can find the gallery over on the right or by clicking <a href="gallery.html">here</a>.
<br><br>
¡Hasta luego!
